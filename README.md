toddlerClock
============

How do you know if it's time to stay in bed if you can't read a clock? If only you had a simple true/false indicator...

toddlerClock is a program written for Arduino that gives visual indication of whether it's time for something to happen, or not. It was designed to keep my 3 year old son in bed.
